# OpenSSL Certificate Authority
This guide demonstrates how to act as your own certificate authority (CA) using the OpenSSL command-line tools. This is useful in a number of situations, such as issuing server certificates to secure an intranet website, or for issuing certificates to clients to allow them to authenticate to a server.
